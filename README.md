It can be fixed based on work done and testing, but using pyzotero may be a better option

Working from this lesson:
Amanda Morton, "Intro to the Zotero API," The Programming Historian 2 (2013), https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/retired/intro-to-the-zotero-api.

pip install pyzotero

Zotero Hello World
Once libZotero is installed, we can use it to talk to the Zotero server using Python. In your text editor, open a new, blank text file, and begin with the following:

#make the libZotero library available
from libZotero import zotero

#make the pyzotero library available
from pyzotero import zotero
